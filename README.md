# The Monty Bytecode Interpreter

PROJECT: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Given By: Julien Barbier
Weight: 2
Team: Victor Ukpongette and Mustorpha Jamiu
DATE: Start - Oct, 17th, 2023
      Stop -  Oct, 20th, 2023	

Learning Objectives:

by the end of the project, we should be able to explain the following;

What do LIFO and FIFO mean
What is a stack, and when to use it
What is a queue, and when to use it
What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
What is the proper way to use global variables

Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added item is the first one to be removed.

Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the element that has been in the queue the longest is the first one to be removed.

This project is designed to fasten us with the knowledge of how to implement stacks and queues in programing,
with the concept of linked lists and arrarys
